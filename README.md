## Technologies Used

* _JavaScript_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _JQuery_

## Description

_This project takes information about the user from a series of questions that they fill out and returns with the programming language that they should start with. Although it may not seem like it at first the questions are a bit silly and some of them do not effect the result, this is ok because the user can do the quiz as many times as they would like and it doesn't matter very much what programming language you start learning first. In this html page a user is able to receive three different options, JavaScript, React, and C#._
